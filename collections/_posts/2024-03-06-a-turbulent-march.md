title: "A turbulent March"
---

I'm currently experiencing some difficulties in my personal life that are,
as always, fairly complicated.  To avert the risk of boring you to sleep
with the unfortunate details, the entire affair is having an impact on my
overall mental health.

However, as [Monty Python taught us][monty-python-always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life],
we should always look on the bright side of life.
Therefore, I'll focus on my new blog!I'm very pleased that I now find myself
with a brand new platform to write and share my thoughts on various topics
and things I think others may find interesting too.

My goal for this blog is to provide interesting, informative content.
I'm planning on writing longer-form, high-effort content in the future,
though I hope my first blog post on encryption has served as a good starter.

I'll end here by saying that I thank you for reading my musings, and hope
you enjoy my future posts on this, albeit very small, corner of the internet.
