# Tweaks are a collection of small tweaks applied to individual layouts
# only when the site is in development mode.
# Tweaks are applied (via the default layout) in the order they're set here.

# Schema:
#   "type" is either:
#    - scss:          converted to CSS and inlined
#    - js:            script
#    - css:           style
#    - raw:           HTML
#
#   "source" is either:
#    - external:      included via referencing the file via path
#    - inline:        inline the resource into the document
#
#   "location" is either:
#    - end-of-body:   placed at end of <body>
#    - end-of-head:   placed in the document's <head>
#    - start-of-head: placed at the start of <head>
#    - start-of-body: placed at the start of <body>
#    - *:             requires manual placement
#
#   "environment" corresponds with the JEKYLL_ENV environmental variable.
#   If an environment value is provided, the tweak will only be applied when
#   the JEKYLL_ENV variable matches the value provided.
#
#   "layouts" is a list of layouts where the respective tweak will automatically
#   be applied -- if it is manually included by way of <tweak.html>, this will have
#   no effect.  It only applies to <include_matching_tweaks.html>.
#   Alternatively, "all" may be supplied to symbolize that the tweak should apply
#   to all layouts.
